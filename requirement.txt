1. Install Python extension in VS Code

2. If clf.pkl, tfidf.pkl and encoder.pkl is not working from here then follow this process to download it
"Run this drive file in Google Collab or Jupyter Notebook"
And download clf.pkl, tfidf.pkl, encoder.pkl by running this code in Google collab or Jupyter Notebook

3. Code to download pkl files from google collab: 
        from google.colab import files
        files.download("clf.pkl")

        from google.colab import files
        files.download("tfidf.pkl")

        from google.colab import files
        files.download("encoder.pkl")

4. After this, Create and open a folder named as Resume_Screening and open New Terminal Run this code:
        pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn PyPDF2
        pip install nltk

5. Next run this code:
        python -m streamlit run app.py
